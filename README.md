# MyPortfolio
This is Portfolio website from the web developer Ashwajit Raut.

## Overview
This is a Django Website by name MyPortfolio where you know about me.

## Motivation
What to do when you are at home due to this pandemic situation? I started to learn Django Framework to get most out of it. I came to know how this django framework works. Finally it is important to work on application (real world application) to actually make a difference.

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.7.4. If you don't have Python installed you can install it. If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required django packages and libraries, run this command in the cmd prompt 'pip install django'.
